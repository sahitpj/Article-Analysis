CHANDIGARH: Call it a loss of momentum after their drubbing in Punjab assembly elections or an attempt to regain lost ground back home, most key leaders of   (AAP) stayed away from the campaigning for the   byelection in Delhi that goes to polls on April 9.

 It was only senior party leader and Dakha MLA H S Phoolka who led a visible campaign in the national capital with an impressive road show on Thursday. "Last week, I had participated in a rally in the constituency,' he said.
 
 Even though he remained inaccessible for comments, AAP's star campaigner   has preferred to concentrate on his constituency Sangrur over the last few weeks attending local events like Kabaddi tournaments and school functions.
 
 A senior party leader close to him confirmed that Mann has not contributed to the Rajouri Garden campaign. This, even as he was the frontrunner in holding over 300 back-to-back rallies across Punjab during the assembly elections. 
 
 In the past too, Mann had campaigned actively for AAP candidates during the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and Delhi assembly polls in 2015.
 
 Another prominent face of the party and Punjab convener   decided to stay in Punjab after the election results. "Leaders from Punjab did their bit as and when the party leadership asked them to pitch in. I was asked to focus on the state unit during this period. Phoolka ji is a familiar face in Delhi and strikes a chord with the voters," said Waraich.
 
 The Rajouri Garden seat fell vacant after sitting legislator Jarnail Singh resigned from the Delhi assembly to contest from Lambi in Punjab against former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal where eventually he lost.
 
 The party's pick is Harjeet Singh, who has a transport business. He started his career as a corporate executive.
