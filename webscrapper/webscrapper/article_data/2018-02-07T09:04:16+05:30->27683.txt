THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: On January 27, a week after the conclusion of the   festival at  , a 20-year old female   was found dead near Valiyanavattom hardly one kilometre away from the sewage treatment plant at  .

 The post-mortem examination of the carcass revealed that it died after large quantity of plastic blocked its alimentary canal, resulting in internal bleeding and failure of the vital organs. Though it is the only, and the first death of the mammal after the complete plastic ban in Sabarimala by the high court in 2016, the forest officials have found that plastic is a key content in the dung of the mammal all over forest region covering the hill shrine.
 
 “Plastic waste is a common sight after the season all along the route from Pamba to Sannidhanam, Azhutha to Pamba and other forest routes. Though the cleaning-up is happening along the routes after the season, the plastic that moves to interior areas are posing a threat to the wildlife,” said  , field director of forest department.
 
 The elephants are attracted by food waste, especially those with salt content like packed foods. They have been found to consume plastic even from inside the incinerator shed. 
 
 The forest department in 2016 had filed an affidavit before the high court after a Sambhar deer died after consuming plastic, on the basis of which the high court imposed a total plastic ban in Sabarimala. But despite this, loads of plastic bottles and packets are still dumped in and around the shrine, after the pilgrimage season. 
 
 Travancore Devaswom Board, however, blamed the forest department for the elephant death. “In the case of the elephant that died, three-metre long plastic sheet used by shopkeepers at Valiyanavattom and Cheriyanavattom was found in its intestine. The shops are leased out by the forest department. They are not doing anything to ensure that   is properly disposed of,” said A Padmakumar, president, TDB.
