Pakistan will have some tough discussions after their crushing defeat by England in the second Test at   on Sunday, head coach   has said.

 
 Pakistan started the two-match Test series with a commanding win over England at Lord's but the hosts dismantled Arthur's side in the second Test, winning by an innings and 55 runs.
 
 Despite the rout, Arthur was confident that his youthful Pakistan team would come back stronger.
 
 "It was a poor display from us coming off such a high at Lord's as we are all about getting our consistency right and trying to play in the right style," Arthur told Sky Sports.
 
 "We'll talk about it, we'll have a hard discussion - we need to dish out a couple of hidings! But they are gutted and if they learn from this, hopefully they can grow and grow quicker."
 
 Pakistan, who beat   in a Test last month, will conclude their tour with two Twenty20 internationals against   on June 12 and 13.
