VIJAYAWADA: Union  ,   on Saturday said that   implementation is a perfect example of cooperative federalism and added on the request of the state governments liquor and petroleum products were not included in the GST list.
 
 Sitaraman who was in Vijayawada to take part in an interactive meet said   were fixed in consultation with all the state governments after several rounds of meetings of GST council in which finance ministers of 29 states, seven union territories are members.
  
 “GST council is a constitution empowered body and it met as many as 17 times to discuss the rates. GST is a revenue neutral model with an aim that it should not be a loss either to Centre or states. Rates have been fixed only after all the states have collectively and unanimously agreed. We ministers have been attending interactive meetings on GST at various towns and cities to explain about GST and clarify issues, doubts raised by traders, entrepreneurs and exporters. A similar exercise has been done before July 1 before the implementation of GST,” said Nirmala Sitaraman.
  
  Stating that GST is being implemented to avoid double taxation and cascading effect on the consumers, Sitaraman said handloom industries having an annual turnover of Rs 20 lakh need not pay any GST.
  
 She pointed that earlier tax burden was only on consumer and now with the introduction of GST the burden is being shared by traders and manufacturers. Sitaraman hoped that exports will improve with the introduction of GST which enables free movement of trucks as toll booths have been removed across the country. To a query, she said some of the states will slowly remove the toll booths as they have already agreed to do so.
