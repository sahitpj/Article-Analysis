NEW DELHI: India views the presence of its professionals in the US as a positive for the US economy. Speaking on the H-1B issue, ministry of external affairs spokesperson   said, “We have conveyed to the US side that H-1B is a trade and business issue, an economy issue.“

 Baglay said during the recent visit to the US by foreign secretary   and commerce secretary Rita Teotia, it was emphasised by senior US officials that curbing illegal immigration and not H-1B are their priority . MEA also referred to a NASSCOM statement that said the loss of premium processing facilities for the H-1B visas would have minimal impact. “You would have seen that senior US officials have stated that illegal immigration and not H-1B is their priority . You would have also seen that from President Trump himself there was a reference to merit based approach on the subject,“ he said.
 
 “It has been our view that the presence of skilled Indian professionals is a positive for the US economy as well. There are, of course, other advantages from the presence of Indian professionals in the US.“
 
 India, he said, had strongly raised the matter of the Kansas shooting. “There is a sense of regret at the unfortunate shooting, commitment to prosecute the matter, support to the family of the deceased, and recognition of the qualities and contribution of Shri Srinivas to Kansas,“ Baglay said.
