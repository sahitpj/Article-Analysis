NEW DELHI: Non-subsidised domestic   refills became costlier by Rs 86 each and will cost Rs 737.50, after state-run fuel retailers raised prices on Wednesday in tune with the global trend. 

 The steepest-ever increase in the price of cylinders in this category will affect households that have surrendered their subsidy or exhausted the quota of 12 subsidised cylinders in a year. Over one crore households have voluntarily given up the cooking gas subsidy, while households with annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh and above do not get a subsidy. 
 
 Before the hike, non-subsidised cylinders cost Rs 651.50. Retailers also raised the price of subsidised cooking gas by 13 paise, to Rs 434.93 per 14.2-kg cylinder. 
 
 Rates have been on the upswing since October 2016. The price of a non-subsidised cylinder priced at Rs 466.50 in Delhi in September has risen by Rs 271 per bottle, or 58%, in six instalments. Earlier, subsidised cooking gas rates had gone up eight times of nearly Rs 2 per cylinder each. 
 
 Jet fuel price went up by Rs 214 per kilolitre to Rs 54,293.38 per kl, on the heels of a 3% hike on February 1.
