LUCKNOW: What is bringing a smile on the face of chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi despite declining tax realization from stamp and   departments and meeting the farmer loan waiver targets? It is the Goods and   ( ) realization in one month in UP, which has recorded highest growth among all states.

 Commercial tax commissioner Mukesh Meshram, who has been spearheading the GST drive in the state, told TOI that it is for the first time in recent years that tax collection has risen to a record 26%.
 
 “This, in the past years, used to be around 10%. Growth in tax collection of 26% was recorded in July, the first month after implementation of GST,” said Meshram.
 
 “GST revenue in the first month after its launch has been Rs 4,782.04 crore. During the same period last year – when GST was not in force – tax realization was Rs 3,810.08 crore,” he added.
 
 “More and more traders are migrating to GST. So far, out of 8.13 lakh registered traders in the state, 2.83 lakh have migrated to GST and the process for the remaining is going on,” said Meshram.
 
 “Uttar Pradesh benefited for being a state with the largest consumer base in the country. However, monitoring by the chief minister and his decision to involve cabinet colleagues in creating awareness around GST gave the move a big push,” added Meshram.
 
 Meshram said revenues would jump further once the entire trading community in the state is registered and this would make implementation of social welfare schemes and development projects easier.
 
 However, the state government is concerned over the sharp decline in stamp and registration revenue, said stamp and registration minister Nand Kumar Gupta, who held a review meeting on Monday.
 
 The minister was surprised by the sharp decline in revenue in the past three months, as compared to the same period last year. In August 2016, revenue from stamp and registration was Rs 1,340 crore while in August this year, it fell to Rs 1,017 crore.
