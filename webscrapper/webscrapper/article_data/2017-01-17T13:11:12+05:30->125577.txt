COIMBATORE: The carcasses of a 30-year-old   and its six-year-old male   were found in a farmland at Thasampalayam in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday morning. 

 Forest officials said the   and its calf were electrocuted when they came into contact with an electric fence in the farmland, situated near Nellimalai reserve forest in Mettupalayam forest range, on Monday night.
 
 A one-and-a-half-year-old calf that suffered injuries was rescued and sent for treatment. 
 
 The land belonged to Palanisamy. The farmer had kept the electric fence to prevent the entry of wild boars. 
 
 District forest officer Ramasubramanian, Mettupalayam forest range officer Nazir and Tangedco officials were in the spot.
