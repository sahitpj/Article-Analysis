 "The political twist in Nagaland which saw NPF part ways with the BJP will not be a threat to the current coalition structure in Manipur," Nimbus told TOI. "Neither the BJP nor the NPF in Manipur has any issue with the development in Nagaland. We strongly believe that the current government in Manipur will run smoothly without any differences and hard feelings among the coalition partners," he added.
 
 Nimbus further said that the Manipur unit of BJP workers have been supporting and assisting BJP candidates in Tripura while the party's vice-president Sh Premananda Sharma is assisting the campaign in Meghalaya. "We had deputed two to three workers for each BJP candidate in Tripura," he said. BJP legislators and ministers from Manipur will also join the campaign in Meghalaya and Nagaland, Nimbus added.
