NEW DELHI: The number of philanthropists in India is growing by leaps and bounds. And this uptick in private philanthropy is expected to increase in the future, thanks to higher GDP growth and an increase in number of ultra-high net-worth individuals ( ).

 Individual philanthropic giving in the country 
  -from about Rs 6,000 crore in 2011 to Rs 36,000 crore in 2016, said a Bain & Company report.
 
 “The role of private philanthropy is critical,“ said  , partner at Bain & Company. “Investing in research, evaluation, advocacy and providing institutional building support to NGOs are some ways in which capital contributors create more impact with their giving.“
 
 The number of UHNWI households in India has doubled since 2011, and their net worth has trebled during this period. The number of people who have volunteered their time and money between 2009 and 2015 has also increased, up 2 and 1.5 times respectively.
 
 The report said the philanthropic ecosystem in India has been thriving due to the combined efforts of both the public and private sectors. Overall, total funds for the development sector have grown at a healthy rate of app roximately 9% over the past five years, increasing from approximately Rs 1.5 lakh crore to approximately Rs 2.2 lakh crore. However, while the government remains the largest contributor (Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2016), its share in total   has been declining steadily . Private contributions primarily accounted for the Rs 70,000 crore in 2016.Private donations made up 32% of total contributions to the development sector in 2016, up from just 15% in 2011.
 
 Funding from individual philanthropists is even outpacing contributions from foreign sources and corporate social responsibility ( ) efforts, according to the report. Although philanthropy from foreign sources has continued to increase over the years, the domestic philanthropy market has overtaken it.
