NOIDA: The residents of Sector 51 have raised concerns about unauthorised mineral water/RO plants being run in neighbouring   village. Nearly half-a-dozen makeshift plants are run by villagers in the area, which has decreased the groundwater level from 60ft to nearly 210ft now, residents said.

 “Unauthorised mineral water plants are one of the major problems in our sector. There are approximately five-six such unauthorised plants in Hoshiyarpur,” said Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary of Sector 51 RWA.
 
 According to Kumar, these plants extract huge amounts of groundwater through boring. “When we started staying here from 2008-09, we used to get groundwater at 60ft below the surface. Today, the groundwater level has gone down to as low as 180 to 210ft. These unauthorised plants are largely responsible for the level going down drastically because they extract huge quantities on a daily basis,” Kumar said.
