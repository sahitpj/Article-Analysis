GREATER NOIDA: More than eight years after they were allotted land by Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), relief is still not in sight for thousands of individual allottees who were allotted land under the residential plot scheme, 2009. Empty promises and repeated assurances have come to a naught despite most of them having paid 90% towards their land. Fed up with the lackadaisical attitude, scores of allottees met Dr  , chairman,   on Friday to lodge their protest.

  A memorandum of their demands was handed over to Kumar, who has assured them possession of nearly 2,500   by Diwali this year. 
 
 Allottees said the YEIDA had committed to hand over the possession of property in 2013. “However, till 2017, there does not seem to be a concrete plan for handing us possession of our plots,” said Sunny Singhal, an allottee. “We are middle class, salaried individuals who have invested our hard-earned money in the land. All we have got from the authority is empty promises and deadlines, which have failed to be met,” he lamented.
