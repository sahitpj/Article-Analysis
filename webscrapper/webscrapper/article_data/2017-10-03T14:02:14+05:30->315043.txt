 Kishore said the step has been initiated to create awareness about illegal wildlife trade through e-commerce platforms. This effort is one of its kind in the world where WCCB has tapped the potential of e-commerce portals to generate awareness and deter wildlife traders using online media for such trade.
 
 This is for the first time that WCCB has involved e-commerce industries for combating wildlife crime in the country. Last year too, WCCB joined hands with major e-business firms like Amazon, Quikr, Indiamart, and   to discuss modalities in curbing illegal wildlife trade through online portals.
 
 Illegal wildlife e-trade was taking on India in a big way. WCCB has no sniffer dogs at parcel venues. Even though accused are caught for animal smuggling, no action is taken against them and they are left to self-regulation.
