NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court dismissed on Friday a petition seeking   probe against some journalists who were allegedly paid off by Italian company Finmeccanica and its subsidiary AgustaWestland to put out reports in favour of the controversial multi-crore VVIP chopper deal. 

 A bench of justices  ,   and M M Shantanagoudar said it could not direct probe against the media without having credible evidence as it would amount to violating their freedom and independence.
 
 "Media has got an independent status in our democracy. We cannot curtail their freedom. It would set a dangerous trend if we allow the probe. This would be an attack on the media and we cannot allow. We cannot allow probe unless there is credible evidence," the bench said.
 
 The court dismissed a plea filed by senior journalist   who alleged that some journalists were virtually "purchased" by the firm for doing stories in favour of the controversial deal.
