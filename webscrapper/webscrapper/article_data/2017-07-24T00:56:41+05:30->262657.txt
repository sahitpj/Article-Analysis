NEW DELHI: Delhi government will be launching six mobile   on Monday to tour the city’s markets and attempt to help   with issues related to  .

 The decision to start the vans was announced by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia about 10 days back after he received feedback that several small traders were facing problems with the new GST regime.
 
 “The   vans will tour the city’s markets and will also set up helpdesks across the city,” said an official. “We found out that the problems being faced by traders are largely very basic. All the vans will have one official who can address all the basic problems.”
 
 The mobile vans, each with a GST officer, will go from market to market. “The vans are being equipped with a loudspeaker so that they can announce their arrival and point for meeting. Then they will set up camp at a central point and assist traders,” said an official. “The government will also tie up with market associations so that we can inform them of the date and time when the vans will be visiting their markets,” he added.
 
 Sisodia, who has maintained that the GST system is good in concept but has not been implemented properly in India, has said that it could lead to tax evasion at one level and harassment of traders at another. 
 
 “It is too early to ascertain the impact of GST on business right now but traders are facing problems. Even now, many traders have not been able to incorporate the new system within their existing billing. We will review the situation in some time,” said an official.
