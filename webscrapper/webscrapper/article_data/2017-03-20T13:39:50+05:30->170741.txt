If you are in a committed relationship with your coffee, chances are you have faced this situation many times - spilling   on your favourite dress or shirt! Even though coffee stains are one of the most tough ones to get rid of, we suggest few simple tricks to get rid of those stubborn stains:

 1. 
 Pour club soda liberally on the stain and blot, continuing until the stain has completely lifted.
 
 2. 
 You can lift coffee stains from your clothing by patting the spot with a towel moistened with undiluted white vinegar just before placing the item in the wash. For large stains, soak the garment overnight in a solution of 3 parts vinegar to 1 part cold water before washing.
 
 3. 
 
 Use a baby wipe to blot up coffee spills; it absorbs both the liquid and the stain.
 
 4. 
 
 This stain remover might surprise some, but many people swear by it. Beat an egg yolk and work into the coffee stain with a towel for about a minute. Rinse thoroughly with water.
