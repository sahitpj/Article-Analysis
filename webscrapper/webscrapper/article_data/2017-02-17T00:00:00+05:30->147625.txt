Before we go ahead with it, let’s refresh our knowledge. Tiger eye is a semi-precious stone with a distinct pattern of rich bronze,   and dark   stripes.
 Tiger eye hair means the same shade family on your strands, but instead of the clearly demarcated lines, the hues are applied with balayage technique, which results in a beautiful blend. Bengaluru-based makeup and hair stylist Kiinjal Mehta says, “This technique a blend of dark and light tones, but in shades of brown and blondes. The best thing about these multi-tone is that it gives a voluminous look.”
