NEW DELHI: With a frontline Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jet and a Chetak helicopter crashing in different parts of the country on Wednesday, the   continues to record an alarmingly high crash rate. Fortunately, the pilots in both the crashes managed to escape safely.

 The armed forces have lost over 60 aircraft and helicopters in crashes, which have killed over 80 people, since 2011. With the two primary reasons being technical defects and human error, the combination of ageing machines, inadequate training to rookie pilots, shoddy maintenance and poor quality of spares continues to be a deadly mix and exacts a heavy toll.
 
 On Wednesday, the Chetak helicopter developed engine failure on a routine sortie from the Bamrauli airfield near Allahabad around 7am. “The two pilots tried to land on an uneven field nearby but the helicopter toppled over,” said an officer.
 
 Seven hours later, the Sukhoi-30MKI took off on a training sortie from the forward  , in   area of Rajasthan, but it also developed a technical snag soon after. The two pilots then went in for a “planned ejection” to parachute down safely at about 2.15pm, but three villagers were left injured on the ground.
 
 While the armed forces are still forced to fly the ageing single-engine Cheetah/Chetak helicopters due to failure of successive governments in taking timely decisions, the crash of the twin-seat Sukhoi “air dominance” fighter is more worrisome.
 
 IAF has now lost at least seven of the 240 Sukhoi-30MKI jets it has inducted till now. In all, India has contracted 272 Sukhois from Russia for over $12 billion, with the bulk of them being “produced under licence” by  .
 
 The Sukhoi fleet is now likely to be grounded for systematic precautionary checks before they can take to the skies again, like it happened after crashes in April 2009 and December 2011.
