DHARAMSALA: Injured Indian skipper   said Friday he would play the fourth Test against Australia only if he was 100 percent fit, keeping up the suspense over his participation in the series decider.

 Kohli, who injured his shoulder during the drawn third Test in Ranchi, said he would undergo fitness tests before taking a final call on whether to take the field in the fourth and final Test which begins Saturday.
 
 "Obviously if I am 100 percent fit for the game (that) is the only condition on which I will take the field," Kohli, 28, said at the pre-match press conference in Dharamsala.
 
 "The physio can explain better (the risks of playing despite carrying an injury). I don't know the magnitude of the risk but all I know is the fitness tests, if I go through them I will take the field."
 
 On Thursday the Indian team management rushed in uncapped batsman Shreyas Iyer as a cover for Kohli, who has led India to victory in nine of their last 12 Tests at home.
 
 Kohli has had a disappointing series against Australia, managing just 46 runs in the first three Tests of a series which is tantalisingly poised at 1-1 as it reaches its climax.
 
 Kohli, who batted in the nets Friday, said the full extent of an injury could only be known in match conditions and that he would strictly follow the advice of the physiotherapist.
 
 "Those are the things you need to keep in mind, the physio wants to give it a bit more time till I test myself," said the right-hander.
 
 "And probably we will take a call on it later tonight or tomorrow (Saturday) so I think we will have to give that much time more for me to make that call with the physiotherapist."
