NEW DELHI: At a marathon meeting with 32   allies that lasted four and a half hours late Monday night, PM   exhorted them to take a pledge for the service of the nation, taking a cue from John F Kennedy’s famous statement: “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask for what you can do for your country”.

 The PM chose to listen to leaders of all the 31 alliance partners and spoke at the end, assuring that their views would be taken into consideration in due course.
 
 Keeping his eye firmly on 2019 parliamentary polls,   asked the partners to strengthen the alliance while laying emphasis on elimination of black money, public debate over poll reforms like simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls and popularising the digital economy focusing on apps like  . 
 
 “Besides, our ultimate goal should be to save poor from money lenders which can be achieved by promoting financial institutions,” Modi said. “People’s expectations are soaring.
 
 We must work for the new aspirational India,” said Modi, bolstered by the express desire of the alliance partners that they were for contesting all future polls under his leadership. 
 
 Leaders of oldest NDA constituents —   and TDP — expressed unflinching faith in Modi as they said the nation is marching briskly under the PM’s leadership.
