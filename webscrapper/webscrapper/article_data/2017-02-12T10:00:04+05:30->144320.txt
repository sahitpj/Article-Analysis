   Numbers appear cold, perhaps even limited, yet they seem definite. But if you delve a little deeper, numbers tell you stories that you didn't know existed. Impact Index, a cricket analytics system created by Jaideep Varma in 2009, is based on a very simple idea — of accounting for every cricket performance first within the context of its match. And after that, the series or tournament the match is from. The quality of a batsman's performance, for instance, is measured on a variety of parameters: Pressure Impact, Partnership Building Impact, Runs Tally Impact, Strike Rate Impact, New Ball Impact, Chasing Impact, Batting Impact, Failure Rate (Batting), Series Defining Performance etc. The new methodology has thrown up a bunch of startling facts that's likely to stir a passionate debate in cricket-crazy India.        No Indian batsman has produced more high-impact performances in critical circumstances (in a series context) than Dravid. In fact, in all Test cricket, only Inzamam-ul-Haq has as many series-defining (SDs) performances as him (eight). Between 2001 and 2006, Dravid was the second highest impact batsman in the world after Inzamam-ul-Haq. In that period, India made considerable strides in world cricket (including notable overseas wins), and it is uncanny how Dravid played the leading role every single time in those landmark wins. He also has the second highest batting consistency in Indian Test history after Sunil Gavaskar. He has the highest Runs Tally Impact (proportion of runs made in every match relative to the match standard, with a higher value on ‘tough runs') and Partnership Building Impact (self-explanatory) in Indian cricket history. And the fourth highest Pressure Impact (of falling wickets) after Gundappa Viswanath, Chandu Borde and VVS Laxman. Interestingly, he even has the fourth highest New Ball Impact (ability to see off the new ball). There are only three batsmen ahead of him, all openers: Gavaskar, Gautam Gambhir and Navjot Sidhu. This is an indication of what a reliable No. 3 batsman he was. Combine all that with his longevity (163 Tests in 16 years, second only to Tendulkar), and his place cannot be disputed.        The conventional view on Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi (or Nawab of Pataudi Jr) is that he was one of India's greatest captains and an unorthodox, fearless player who gave India a sense of belief. And that he was a very good batsman who would have touched greatness if he had not lost one eye in an accident six months before his Test debut. All of this is true. But he was more than this — in deed, not just in potential.    In the history of Test cricket (minimum 40 Tests), no batsman in the world has absorbed more pressure (of falling wickets) in his career than MAK Pataudi. Those immediately below him include Peter May, Andy Flower, Angelo Mathews, Kane Williamson, Brian Lara, Warwick Armstrong, Younis Khan and Clem Hill (Williamson and Younis have ongoing careers, of course). Perhaps, more than anything else, this demonstrates Pataudi's greatness. Losing one eye was not his only cricketing tragedy — he was also not part of a world-beating side. It would be entirely human to not be fully motivated in such circumstances but it did not stop him from repeatedly playing at his best when his team needed it the most.    His batting average of 35 in 46 Tests (between 1961 and 1975) does not suggest that he was a world beater. However, in the five years when he was at his peak (1964–68), he averaged 56 in Australia (in three Tests), 45 in England (three Tests) and 43 overall in 25 Tests. Even this does not tell the real story, given how little success Indian teams had in those days, especially overseas, and how many players scored more runs and averaged more than him in world cricket.  Pataudi scored tough runs, more than anybody else in the world in that period. In fact, he was the second highest impact batsman in the world in this period (minimum 20 Tests), after Garry Sobers, partly because of his extremely high Pressure Impact. He also had one series-defining performance (vs Australia, October 1964) to his credit at a time when India hardly won any series.        Navjot Sidhu as a higher impact Test batsman than Sehwag and Azharuddin, despite averaging just 42.13 with the bat and registering only 9 tons, will raise eyebrows. But when one analyses the significance and timing of his contributions, Sidhu emerges as the fifth highest-impact batsman in India's Test cricket history, after Dravid, Tendulkar, Gavaskar and Viswanath (minimum 50 Tests). Despite a relatively high failure rate, Sidhu's high New Ball Impact and Partnership Building Impact suggest his effectiveness as an opener.    But the big reason for his high impact are those two series-defining performances he registered in just 51 Tests. In India's only Test match win (also series win) outside its own shores in the 1990s against Sri Lanka (1993), Sidhu was India's highest impact batsman (with 82 and 104). Then against Australia in the famous momentum-changing Chennai Test of 1998, Sidhu was India's second highest-impact batsman (with 62 and 64) and in the second innings, with India still in the arrears, he began a famous assault of Shane Warne (which Tendulkar continued spectacularly with his classic unbeaten 155). India came back from behind to win this match and later, the series. The frequency at which he produced a series-defining performance is the main reason why he is higher impact than Virender Sehwag — the latter had three SDs in 104 Tests compared to Sidhu's two in 51.    Also, Sidhu scored a higher proportion of runs in the matches he batted (Runs Tally Impact) than Azharuddin, and thus is of marginally higher impact than him with the bat. Interestingly, Sidhu's longevity is not as low as his tally of 51 Tests suggests, because his Test career actually lasted 16 years.
