NEW DELHI: The Dalai Lama said he hopes that President   and Russian President   will work together for global peace.

 The exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists said the world needed leaders with compassion. He made the remarks Saturday at a program in New Delhi organized by the women's chapter of an industry group, according to the press statement.
 
 He said the world is moving toward peace and non-violence, and he hopes Trump and Putin will come closer and work toward creating global peace.
 
 The Dalai Lama had said in Mongolia in November that he had ``no worries'' about Trump's election as US president and looked forward to meeting him after he took office. Trump was inaugurated Friday.
 
 The Dalai Lama has met former U.S. presidents, including four meetings with Barack Obama. Such meetings anger Beijing, which accuses the Tibetan leader of trying to split Tibet from China. The Dalai Lama says he simply wants a higher degree of autonomy under  .
 
 The Dalai Lama has been based in India's northern hill town of Dharmsala since fleeing Tibet during an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.
