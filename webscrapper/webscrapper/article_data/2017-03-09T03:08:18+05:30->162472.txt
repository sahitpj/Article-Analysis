 "Opposition parties should learn a lesson from the father of the slain terrorist," said BJP national spokesperson Shrikant Sharma. He said the   poses a potent threat to India and agencies have again underlined their resolve to finish it. 
 
 "It is unfortunate that some parties are doing politics over it," Sharma said. Noting that the  , a central agency, besides Telangana and   police coordinated with each other in the operation, he said it was an example of "Team India" spirit which Prime Minister   has often spoken about. The suspected terrorist, Saifullah, was killed after 12 hours of operation in Lucknow. He is suspected to be linked with the blast in the Bhopal-Ujjain train on Tuesday.
