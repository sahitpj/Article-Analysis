The gender of your baby could never affect or influence your parenting or behaviour. Whether it’s a baby boy or baby girl, your brain would respond equally to their desires and needs. But there are researches that have a different take on this. 

  According to a study published in the   Behavioral  , fathers often treat their   differently than the baby boys. Researchers have found out that their brain responds differently when they interact with their toddler girls.
 
  It also revealed that dads do respond differently to their daughters’ happy facial expressions when compared to their toddler sons.
 
  The study was done on 52 fathers and MRIs showed that they reacted differently to pictures of their daughters than their toddler boys. The study also found out that fathers sang more to their daughters and were open about their emotions. On the other hand, with their young sons, they used more words which were related to winning and achievements like 'top' and 'proud'.
 
  The researchers also concluded that when it comes to responding to a crying child, fathers of daughters paid more and quick attention than fathers who had sons. The study is a clear indication for fathers who have sons, that without even realizing they might get less attentive and emotionally less involved to their needs. Hence, they need to understand that even they do not know it but the way they are responding to their sons might not be a healthy practice for a  .
