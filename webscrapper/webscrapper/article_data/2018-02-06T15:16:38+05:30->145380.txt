 PEMRA will be ensure that media follows the court orders.
 
 Valentine Day has been controversial in Pakistan and every year zealots of religious parties try to terrorise youngsters celebrating the day.
 
 But it is for the first time that a high court banned its celebrations.
 
 
 
 
 
 Only a small minority in the conservative country openly observe the day and that too in the big cities.
 
 Last year, President Mamnoon Hussain had also urged the nation not to celebrate Valentine's Day and said that it has no connection with the country's culture and should be avoided.
 
 He had urged the people to maintain Pakistan's religious and national identity.
 
 The Valentine's Day activities have often been disrupted in the past in Pakistan by supporters of hardline parties like Jamaat-e-Islami.
