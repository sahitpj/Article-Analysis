NEW DELHI: Almost a month after the rollout of GST,   said on Sunday that the “smooth transition” to such a huge measure in a vast country involving crores of people was historic and could be a case study for universities around the world.

 “I feel very happy and satisfied when a poor person writes to say how, because of GST... prices of various items have come down,” the PM said on ‘Mann ki Baat’.
 
 “I call GST, good and simple tax. Indeed, it has produced a big positive effect on our economy in a very short time span,” he said, emphasising that GST was a fine example of the collective strength of Indians. Describing GST’s rollout as an example of cooperative federalism, the PM said all states were partners in it.
 
 He noted how highways had become snarl-free after GST rollout. “Pollution levels have come down with the increased speed of trucks. Goods are also being transported much faster,”   said.
