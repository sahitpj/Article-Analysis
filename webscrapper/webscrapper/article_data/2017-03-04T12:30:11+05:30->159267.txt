 While there is no bar on the publication of   48 hours before the polling, a rule introduced by the Commission during the Bihar Assembly polls says that such advertisements should be cleared by its media certification and monitoring committee.
 
 It states that without approval no newspaper will publish such advertisements.
 
 The new rule was enforced after the BJP brought out some controversial advertisements during the Bihar elections.
