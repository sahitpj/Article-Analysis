NEW DELHI: A report by the   ( ) on direct taxes, tabled in   last week, has criticised the I-T department for being selective in picking up cases, while ignoring thousands of   engaged in money laundering in the commercial hub of Mumbai which were detected by other enforcement agencies.

 The report cited the example of more than 2,000 shell companies that were unearthed by the   in 2011. They were engaged in bogus billing to convert unaccounted cash worth over Rs 10,000 crore. 
 
 It said the sales tax department uploaded details of these companies and their operators on its website and provided enough details to investigate the real beneficiaries, but the I-T department did little to track the culprits.
 
 The CAG report said during 2008-09, the Maharashtra sales tax department told the Bombay high court that it had investigated around 1,555 hawala operators involving some 39,488 beneficiaries, who during the course of previous three years had taken accommodation entries (indulged in fictitious transactions) for around Rs 1,333 crore.
 
 At present, the list contains around 2,059 dealers who had issued invoices involving tax evasion of more than Rs 10,640 crore, the report said. The CAG asked the I-T department to share data on action taken against these dealers. 
 
 However, the audit pointed out that “no such data was shared with the audit team despite a reminder and a meeting with them in May 2016”.
 
 “The audit noticed that the assessees either did not file the returns or filed returns with meagre or nil income or stopped filing returns in later years,” it observed. The I-T department, it said, took up for scrutiny only those cases where income was reported.
 
 It did not take any action to examine the veracity of the facts reported therein nor did it fully follow the information provided by its own investigation wing, CAG noted.
