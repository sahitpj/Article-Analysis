Panaji: A crackdown on violators of traffic rules may have led to a spurt in the sale of helmets despite the imposition of   at 18%, but the same does not seem to be holding true when it comes to riders using the protective gear responsibly.

 “We often catch riders carrying their helmet on their arms instead of wearing it on their heads. This not only puts their lives in jeopardy but can also risk the safety of others on the road,” a transport official said.
 
 TOI had reported on September 11 that in 2017, road accidents had claimed 198 lives in Goa till August 31. Of these, 110 deaths had resulted from head injuries directly attributed to riders not wearing helmets.
 
 “Road Safety Week is a time when citizens make an effort to conform to rules. There is an impetus to buy new helmets during this period,” said Hitesh Vora, proprietor of United Enterprises that sells helmets, adding that the sale of women’s helmets has seen a huge jump in the past week. “More women are buying helmets now due to the compulsion to wear helmets in city limits as well as on highways,” he said.
 
 In the first half of this year alone, the transport department recorded a total of 89,696 helmet violations. Most violators are let off with a warning (categorised as counselling) or by paying a nominal fine, prompting the Ponda wing of NGO Goa Road Safety Forum (GSRF) to push for an increase in the fine amount.
 
 “A notification has been issued by the government to hike the fines, but it is yet to be implemented in the state. The fine for not wearing a helmet should be increased from Rs 100 to Rs 800. We have spoken to the deputy collector in Ponda to have the transport department’s enforcement team look into this on priority,” said Santosh Manjrekar of GSRF.
